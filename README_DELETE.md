This is a template repository to begin R-based projects

It is created with an R package like structure

- R folder for r functions
- renv initialized 
- gitignore
- devcontainer

The devcontainer pulls from victor2wy/rstudio -> a docker image built on the latest R version and comes pre-installed with some commonly used packages. It also comes with rstudio-server installed.


TODO:

- [ ] expose rstudio-server with port forwarding to devcontainer
- [ ] improve vscode dev experience
  - [ ] add radian
  - [ ] QOL editing things like rlanguageserver, shortcuts
  - [ ] add httpgd
- [ ] add python
- [ ] ensure quarto works
