This is a template repository to begin R-based projects

It is created with an R package like structure

- R folder for r functions
- renv initialized 
- gitignore
- devcontainer

The devcontainer pulls from victor2wy/rstudio -> a docker image built on the latest R version and comes pre-installed with some commonly used packages. It also comes with rstudio-server installed.


TODO:

- [x] expose rstudio-server with port forwarding to devcontainer
- [x] improve vscode dev experience
  - [x] add radian
  - [x] QOL editing things like rlanguageserver, shortcuts
  - [x] add httpgd
- [x] add python
- [x] ensure quarto works
